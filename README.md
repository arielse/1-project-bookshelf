# The Book Shelf
A place to keep information about the books you have read and what you thought of them.

A full stack CRUD app in which you can:
- search for books in a small database
- register as a user
- login
- add books to your "shelf"
- review books
- read others reviews of books
- add in personal info about yourself

For this app I used Ruby, HTML, CSS.

This app is hosted on Heroku here:

## The Process
I started by brainstorming several ideas for apps I could do. I finally landed on this one as it seemed doable in the time alloted and I love books.
I then outlined how the app would work, which you can see in the *planning* folder. After which I did some wireframe sketches of all the pages I wanted on the site and what their basic layout would be: *planning/wireframe.jpg*. When this was done I set up my database and started coding in Ruby.

## Challenges
My main challenge for this app was getting all of the database table structure correct, and making the HTTP requests work correctly. Getting database tables to connect to each other with foreign keys, and then getting that information from the correct corresponding tables was also a challenge.

## The Front-End
I really enjoyed doing the front-end development. I selected a small palette of colours to work with and made the design clean and simple.
